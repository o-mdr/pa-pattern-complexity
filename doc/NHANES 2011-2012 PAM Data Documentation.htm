        <h2 id="Component_Description">Component Description</h2><p>The 
physical activity monitor (PAM) component was reintroduced to NHANES in 
2011. NHANES participants were asked to wear the PAM for seven 
consecutive days to collect objective information on 24-hour movement 
when awake and asleep.</p>
<p>
Traditionally, physical activity information has been collected in 
NHANES through questionnaires. Self-reported interview data, while 
helpful, have limitations including: 1) respondents' perceptions of 
activity intensity vary, and 2) periods of physical activity are 
difficult for respondents to recall and quantify. NHANES interview data 
for children and adolescents less than 16 years of age are usually 
provided by a proxy respondent and may be incomplete. Children may spend
 large amounts of time away from home and engage in sporadic periods of 
activity that are difficult for a proxy respondent to recall and 
quantify.</p>
<p>
Objective measurement of physical activity with accelerometers had been 
implemented in NHANES 2003-2006. The PAM used in NHANES 2011-2014 
measured acceleration (i.e., on the x-, y-, and z-axes) every 1/80th of a
 second (80 Hz). The device also measured ambient light levels every 
second (1 Hz). The 80 Hz accelerometer measurements and the 1 Hz ambient
 light measurements were summed over each minute, hour, and day for each
 participant. The following four datasets, including a header file and 
corresponding summary datasets at the minute, hour, and day level, were 
produced for the release.</p>
<p>
A)	PAM Header File (PAXHD_G):
<br>
<br>
This file contains one record for each eligible participant. It includes the information listed below:
<br>
</p>
<ul style="margin: 0px; padding-left: 40px;">
    <li>Whether the participant has PAM data available;</li>
    <li>Accelerometer device identifier;</li>
    <li>Day of the week the accelerometer measurements were started;</li>
    <li>The number of days the measurements were taken;</li>
    <li>The timestamps for the first and last data points;</li>
    <li>Whether the PAM was worn on the non-dominant hand; and</li>
    <li>The orientation of the PAM when it was placed on the wrist.</li>
    <br>
</ul>
<p>
B)	Summary datasets:
</p>
<ol style="margin: 0px; padding-left: 48px;">
    <li>Minute Summary File (PAXMIN_G): one record per minute for each participant;</li>
    <li>Hour Summary File (PAXHR_G): one record per hour for each participant;</li>
    <li>Day Summary File (PAXDAY_G): one record per day for each participant;</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p>
Each of these minute/hour/day summary files contains multiple records 
per participant (who has at least one minute of data), and provides the 
information listed below:
<br>
</p>
<ul style="margin: 0px; padding-left: 40px;">
    <li>Acceleration measurements obtained on the x-, y-, or z-axes 
summarized at the minute level. These summary measures in the minute 
summary file (PAXMIN_G) are specified in Monitor-Independent Movement 
Summary (MIMS) units, which is a non-proprietary, open-source, 
device-independent universal summary metric developed by researchers at 
Northeastern University (John et al., 2019);</li>
    <li>Sums of the acceleration measurements obtained on all three axes
 (i.e., triaxial values from x-, y-, and z-axes) at the minute/hour/day 
level;</li>
    <li>Sums of ambient light measures (lux) at the minute/hour/day level, and the standard deviation for lux at the minute level;    </li>
    <li>The day when the measurements used for the minute/hour/day summary record were taken (i.e., first day, second day…etc.);  </li>
    <li>Day of the week the measurements used for the minute/hour/day summary record were taken;</li>
    <li>The starting time of the day, usually 00:00:00, except for the first day of measurement, in the day summary record;    </li>
    <li>The starting data point number for the minute/hour/day summary record;</li>
    <li>The total minutes of data included in the hour/day summary record and total number of seconds in the minute summary record;</li>
    <li>Total number of the 80 Hz acceleration measurements included in 
the minute/hour/day summary record that were logged while the device was
 in idle sleep mode;</li>
    <li>Whether the measurements in the minute summary record were taken
 during a wake, sleep, non-wear, or unknown time period as classified by
 an algorithm (see Analytic Notes);</li>
    <li>Total number of valid minute measurements included in the hour/day summary record;</li>
    <li>Number of&nbsp;minutes of valid measurement included in the 
hour/day summary record that were classified as taken during a wake, 
sleep, non-wear, or unknown time period; and</li>
    <li>Data quality, including indicators identifying various conditions for invalid minute measurements.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id="Eligible_Sample">Eligible Sample</h2><p>In 2011, 
all participants aged 6 years and older were asked to wear a PAM for 7 
consecutive days. In 2012, the target age group was extended to 
participants aged 3 and older. Due to disclosure concerns, only data 
from participants aged 6 years and older are included in the present 
file and released publicly. Data collected in 2012 for participants aged
 3-5 years are available through the NCHS Research Data Center (RDC).</p><h2 id="Protocol_and_Procedure">Protocol and Procedure</h2><p>Participants
 were asked to wear the PAM starting on the day of their exam in the 
NHANES Mobile Examination Center (MEC) and to keep wearing the PAM all 
day and night for seven full days (midnight to midnight) and remove it 
on the morning of the 9th day. The device used in NHANES was the 
ActiGraph model GT3X+, manufactured by ActiGraph of Pensacola, FL. This 
model was chosen because of its ability to obtain triaxial measure, its 
battery life, and its water resistance. According to the manufacturer’s 
manual, the device is water resistant in accordance with the 
International Protection Rating: IPX7 and can be immersed in one meter 
of water for up to 30 minutes (ActiGraph, 2013). The devices were 
programmed to begin detecting and recording the magnitude of 
acceleration at 80 Hz sampling intervals at the end of the participant's
 MEC exam session and to stop recording data eight days later (i.e., on 
the 9th calendar day). The device was placed on a mesh wristband (like a
 watch), custom fitted for each participant's wrist and worn on the 
non-dominant hand, if possible. The participant was told not to do 
anything with the device except to wear it. If the participant needed to
 remove it, for any reason, he/she was instructed to put it back on the 
same wrist in the same orientation, as soon as possible.</p>
<p>
A toll-free number and information materials describing the PAM were 
given to the participant. No activity logs, diaries, or records were 
kept by the participant. The PAMs were returned by mail in postage-paid 
padded envelopes provided to each participant.</p>
<p>
For further details see the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2011-2012/manuals/Physical_Activity_Monitor_Manual.pdf">PAM procedures manual</a>.
</p><h2 id="Quality_Assurance_&amp;_Quality_Control">Quality Assurance &amp; Quality Control</h2><p>Survey
 staff completed an examiner training program that covered the basic 
operating features of the PAM, equipment operation, subject recruitment 
strategies, PAM device initialization, and troubleshooting. Field 
performance and response rates were monitored by NCHS and contractor 
staff.</p>
<p>
Once PAMs were received from participants, data were downloaded from the
 devices. In 2019, contractors at Northeastern University in Boston, MA 
under the direction of PAM component collaborators from the National 
Cancer Institute (NCI) and staff from the National Center for Health 
Statistics (NCHS) reviewed these data.  The data quality review 
considered the properties of the raw acceleration measures, which are in
 units of gravity (<em>g</em>). Raw signals were processed to determine 
signal patterns that were unlikely to be a result of human movement. For
 example, maximum or minimum values (±6 <em>g</em>) for extended periods
 of time, spikes in values, and impossible values (e.g., no 
gravitational acceleration observed, etc.). Individual 80 Hz 
accelerometer measurement data were flagged as "invalid" if they met any
 of the following conditions:
<br>
</p>
<ol style="margin: 0px; padding-left: 48px;">
    <li>Acceleration spikes recorded for the x-, y-, or z-axis at 80 Hz 
level: A spike is recorded whenever the change between two adjacent 
samples of raw accelerometer data in the same axis is greater than or 
equal to 11 <em>g</em>;</li>
    <li>Maximum gravity values on the x-, y-, or z-axis: Any value greater than 5.95 <em>g</em> is deemed as near or above the maximum g value measured by the device (i.e., +6<em>g</em>);</li>
    <li>Contiguous minimum gravity values on the x-, y-, or z-axis: Any value less than -5.95 <em>g</em> is deemed as near or lower than the minimum <em>g</em> value measured by the device (i.e., -6 <em>g</em>);</li>
    <li>Contiguous impossible gravity measures such as, zero gravity measures on the x-, y-, or z-axis:  Data with less than 0.01 <em>g</em> change per axis (indicating the device is not moving) and the vector magnitude of the x-, y-, or z-axis is greater than 1.25 <em>g </em>(indicating
 the gravitational component exerted on a non-moving device is 
unrealistically large), for at least six contiguous samples (i.e., 75 
milliseconds);</li>
    <li>Contiguous adjacent zero values on the x-, y-, and z-axis: 3 or 
more contiguous measures are zero on all three axes (contiguous measure 
can continue between minutes, hours, or days);</li>
    <li>Contiguous adjacent identical non-zero values on the x-, y-, or 
z-axis: all three axes are equal and contiguous but not zeros 
(contiguous adjacent measures can continue between minutes, hours, or 
days);</li>
    <li>Occurrence of spikes on the x-, y-, or z-axis in a 1-second time
 period: within the 1-second windows of data containing 12 Hz or more of
 fast (less than 100 milliseconds) and large (greater than or equal to 
11 <em>g</em>) changes in x-, y-, or z-axis values. This test checks for
 unusually high frequencies of spike-like behavior, but the spikes do 
not necessarily occur within two adjacent samples, as they must for the 
acceleration spikes check specified in above item #1;</li>
    <li>Interval jumps in the data on the x-, y-, or z-axis: There are at least three <em>g</em> values that are occurring at least 10 times each in a second, and those three most occurring <em>g</em> values are at least ±0.5 <em>g</em> apart from one another; and</li>
    <li>Time periods adjacent to invalid data: the measure is adjacent 
to a time period that has one of the other data quality conditions 
flagged in this list.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id="Data_Processing_and_Editing">Data Processing and Editing</h2><p>The
 header file and the minute/hour/day summary files were reviewed for 
outliers and unreasonable values. The criteria used for unreasonable 
data were based on published literature and expert judgment.
</p>
<p>Not every eligible NHANES participant has a data file. For example, 
if a participant refused to wear the PAM, did not return it, or the data
 could not be retrieved from a damaged PAM, then the participant does 
not have a data file. Each participant may have up to 9 days of summary 
records. Per the protocol, the first and last day of data collection for
 each participant are partial days. For most participants, a complete 
data collection
constitutes 193 hours. In some cases, e.g., due to battery depletion, 
data
collection was shorter. A small proportion of participant data files 
include
194 hours.</p>
<p> The data files from the PAM were collected and downloaded in 
ActiGraph GT3x format. The GT3x files were converted to comma-separated 
value (csv) files
following the <a href="http://spades-documentation.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/mhealth-format.html?id=5.1">mHealth format</a>&nbsp;to facilitate processing the 80 Hz data. The minute/hour/day files are in the SAS&nbsp;format.
</p>
<p><b>PAXSTS</b> (Physical activity monitor data status)<br>
This header file (PAXHD_G) variable indicates if the participant has PAM
 data available in the summary files. Only participants with at least 
one minute of 80 Hz PAM data downloaded from the returned device have 
records in the summary files and have PAXSTS coded as "1 (Yes)".</p>
<p><b>PAXSENID</b> (Accelerometer device identifier)<br>
This header file (PAXHD_G) variable indicates the unique serial number 
for the accelerometer device that the participant wore. The original 
serial number from manufacture was modified with the format retained. 
For budgetary reasons, accelerometer devices were reused after being 
sanitized during data collection. Participants who wore the same device 
would have the same device ID in their records.</p>
<p><b>PAXFDAY</b> (Day of the week the accelerometer measurements were started)<br>
This header file (PAXHD_G) variable indicates the day of the week when 
the PAM first started to record movement measures (i.e., Sun, Mon. 
etc.).</p>
<p><b>PAXLDAY</b> (The last day when the measurements taken)<br>
This header file (PAXHD_G) variable indicates the last day that the 
participant had data recorded in the PAM. Each participant was asked to 
wear the PAM and have the measurements taken for 9 days. As mentioned 
above, the first and last day of data collection for each participant 
are partial days.</p>
<p><b>PAXFTIME</b> (First data point timestamp)<br>
This
header file (PAXHD_G) variable indicates the time (in HH:MM:SS format) of
the first data point in the GT3X file. For NHANES participants, this counter
began at a prespecified time after each exam session in the exam center.</p>
<p><b>PAXETLDY</b> (Timestamp at the end of the last day)<br>
This header file (PAXHD_G) variable indicates the time (in HH:MM:SS 
format) at the end of the last day. This was computed from start time, 
number of samples, and sampling rate.</p>
<p><b>PAXHAND</b> (PAM worn on non-dominant hand)<br>
This header file (PAXHD_G) variable indicates whether the PAM was placed
 on the wrist of the non-dominant hand (the default placement for the 
PAM). The dominant hand is generally the one that person uses to write, 
or for young children, the hand used for “eating, drawing, or grabbing 
things”. If a non-dominant hand could not be identified, then the 
default option was to place it on the left wrist.</p>
<p><b>PAXORENT</b> (Surface orientation of the PAM when it was placed on the wrist)<br>
This header file (PAXHD_G) variable indicates if the PAM was placed on 
the dorsal or palmar surface of the wrist while in the MEC. The default 
placement was the dorsal surface.</p>
<p><b>PAXDAYM, PAXDAYH, PAXDAYD</b> (The day when PAM measurements for this minute/hour/day summary record were taken)<br>
These variables indicate the day (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) when the 
measurements used for the minute/hour/day summary record were taken. For
 example, a code of "2" indicating the measurements used in the summary 
record were taken on the 2nd day of PAM wear by the participant.</p>
<p><b>PAXDAYWM, PAXDAYWH, PAXDAYWD</b> (Day of the week for the minute/hour/day summary record)<br>
These variables indicate the day of the week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) 
when the measurements used for the minute/hour/day summary record were 
taken.
</p>
<p><b>PAXSSNMP, PAXSSNHP, PAXSSNDP</b> (Starting 80 Hz sample number for the minute/hour/day summary record)<br>
The 80 Hz sample&nbsp;number for the first data point used for the 
minute/hour/day summary record. For example, a value of "9600" in 
PAXSSNMP indicates the minute summary record used data starting from the
 120th second (i.e., 9600 ÷ 80 Hz = 120) since the PAM began to measure 
acceleration for that participant. The sample number was identified 
based on the starting time the measurements were taken, regardless of 
whether it contained valid or flagged data.</p>
<p><b>PAXMSTD</b> (Starting time of the day)<br>
This day summary file (PAXDAY_G) variable indicates the starting time 
for PAM measurement in the day in HH:MM:SS format. It usually contains 
the value of “00:00:00”, except for the first day of the data collection
 since the PAM was not worn at the beginning of the day. It is not 
necessarily the starting time of the MIMS computation, although they 
will nearly always be the same time. </p>
<p><b>PAXTSM, PAXTMH, PAXTMD</b> (Total seconds/minutes with data in the minute file or in the hour/day files)<br>
PAXTSM represents the total seconds of data included in the minute 
summary record, it includes all seconds in this minute with data and was
 computed from
the number of 80 Hz samples and rounded to an integer value.&nbsp;PAXTMH
 and PAXTMD indicates the total minutes of data included in the hour/day
 summary record, and they were determined by dividing the total seconds 
of data in this hour/day by 60.</p>
<p><b>PAXAISMM, PAXAISMH, PAXAISMD</b> (Total number of 80 Hz acceleration measurements logged during idle sleep mode)<br>
These variables encoded the total number of the 80 Hz acceleration 
measurements included in the minute/hour/day summary record that were 
logged while the device was in idle sleep mode (ISM). The count includes
 all data, regardless whether it was flagged as "invalid" during quality
 control review. While taking measurements, the devices had their ISM on
 as a battery saving feature that was a default setting of the device 
firmware when NHANES data collection commenced. The device enters a 
sleep or low power state after experiencing 10 seconds of inactivity 
(fluctuation on the accelerometer &lt; +/- 40 m<em>g</em>). After 
entering this low power state, the device checks once every second to 
determine if the unit has moved. While in sleep mode, the last measured 
accelerometer value is written into memory at the device's preset sample
 rate. Since the device is set to measure at 80 Hz, it will store the 
last known accelerometer reading 80 times every second. The device will 
then wake up and check for movement. If no movement (&lt;+/- 40 m<em>g</em>)
 was detected, this pattern would continue. Otherwise, the unit would 
exit sleep mode and continue measuring in normal fashion. At very low 
levels of movement, this will impact the output of the device, including
 the output of MIMS-units. When ISM is triggered, very small amounts of 
movement are not measured; such small amounts of movement are useful to 
distinguish sleep and non-wear. This feature impacts the algorithm 
design and findings on sleep/wear/non-wear classification.</p>
<p><b>PAXVMH, PAXVMD</b> (Total number of valid minutes in the hour/day)<br>
These two variables in the hour/day summary files indicate the total 
number of minutes in the hour/day record with data considered valid 
because none of the measures within that minute was flagged during the 
QC review.</p>
<p><b>PAXMTSM, PAXMTSH, PAXMTSD</b> (MIMS triaxial value for the minute/hour/day)<br>
The MIMS-unit minute summary acceleration measurements obtained on the 
x-, y-, and z-axis (i.e., PAXMXM, PAXMYM, and PAXMZM) are summed up and 
released as the variable PAXMTSM in the minute summary file (PAXMIN_H). 
PAXMTSM is coded as "-0.01" if any of the summary measures for the x-, 
y-, or z-axis are
coded as "-0.01" which indicates that the MIMS-unit could not be 
computed for that axis for that minute. The MIMS-unit calculation for 
the minute was based on a universal summary metric and does not take the
"valid/invalid" QC flags into account. However, MIMS triaxial value for 
the hour/day is calculated as the sum of PAXMTSM only for valid minutes 
for the hour/day and is released as PAXMTSH/PAXMTSD in the hour/day 
summary file (i.e., PAXHR/PAXDAY).</p>
<p><b>PAXMXM, PAXMYM, PAXMZM</b> (MIMS x-, y-, or z-axis specific value for the minute)<br>
These variables are included in the minute summary file (PAXMIN_G) to 
indicate the acceleration measurements obtained on the x-, y-, or z-axis
 after being summarized in MIMS-units. These summaries include all 
seconds of data collected, regardless whether they were flagged as 
"invalid" during quality control review. A -0.01 value encoded in these 
variables means it was not possible to compute the MIMS-unit value 
(e.g., not enough data in the one-minute window). Sometimes, the 
MIMS-unit value may not be computed at
the start of the day. This is very rare. Data from this minute are not 
included in the aggregation of the triaxial value of the minute 
(PAXMTSM) if "-0.01" was encoded for any of the axis summaries for the 
minute.</p>
<p><b>PAXPREDM</b> (Predicted wake/sleep/non-wear status during the minute)<br>
This variable in the minute summary file (PAXMIN_G) was established 
using a machine learning algorithm with the raw data collected during 
the minute. The PAM wearing status of the minute was classified as 
"wake", "sleep", "non-wear", or "unknown". A "wake" status indicates the
 participant is likely to be awake during the minute, and the "sleep" 
status indicates the participant is likely to be asleep based on the 
algorithm. The "non-wear" status indicates the algorithm suggested that 
the participant did not wear the PAM during this minute, and the 
"unknown" status indicates that the algorithm could not determine the 
status for this minute. Please see the Analytic Notes section for 
further details regarding the algorithm used in this feature.</p>
<p><b>PAXTRANM</b> (Transition flag for wake/sleep/non-wear)<br>
This variable in the minute summary file (PAXMIN_G) file indicates 
whether the two 30-second windows used to compute the 
wake/sleep/non-wear status for a given 60 seconds differ. The 
wake/sleep/non-wear algorithm operates on 30-second windows. A value of 
"1" indicates the two 30-second windows were not the same (i.e., a 
transition in classification of wear status occurred during this 
minute). For example, the first 30-second window of this minute record 
was classified as sleep, but the next 30-second window of this minute 
was classified as wake. The minute records that contain two 30-second 
windows with different status classifications (e.g., wake/sleep, etc.) 
are called transition minutes. When the minutes of wake, sleep, and 
non-wear were summed at the hour and day levels, transition minutes are 
flagged as "unknown".</p>
<p><b>PAXWWMH, PAXSWMH, PAXNWMH, PAXUMH</b> (Valid wake/sleep/non-wear/unknown minutes in the hour)<br>
These variables in the hour summary file (PAXHR_G) indicate the number 
of valid minutes in the hour by algorithm assigned PAM wearing status. 
PAXWWMH provides the valid wake wear minutes; PAXSWMH provides the valid
 sleep wear minutes; and PAXNWMH provides the valid non-wear minutes.  
PAXUMH is the number of valid minutes for which the algorithm could not 
make a determination (i.e., valid data exist, but appear ambiguous to 
the algorithm). The sum of values encoded in PAXWWMH, PAXSWMH, PAXNWMH, 
and PAXUMH equals to the value provided in PAXVMH (total number of valid
 minutes in the hour).</p>
<p><b>PAXWWMD, PAXSWMD, PAXNWMD, PAXUMD</b> (Valid wake/sleep/non-wear/unknown minutes in the day)<br>
These variables in the day summary file (PAXDAY_G) indicate the number 
of valid minutes in the day by algorithm assigned PAM wearing status. 
PAXWWMD provides the valid wake wear minutes; PAXSWMD provides the valid
 sleep wear minutes; and PAXNWMD provides the valid non-wear minutes.  
PAXUMD is the number of valid minutes for which the algorithm could not 
make a determination (i.e., valid data exist, but appear ambiguous to 
the algorithm). The sum of values encoded in PAXWWMD, PAXSWMD, PAXNWMD, 
and PAXUMD equals to the value provided in PAXVMD (total number of valid
 minutes in the day).</p>
<p><b>PAXLXSM, PAXLXSH, PAXLXSD</b> (Sum of the ambient light measures for the minute/hour/day)<br>
These variables encode the sum of the ambient light measures (lux) for 
the minute/hour/day. The PAM device records lux every 1-second (1 Hz). 
Only lux values from valid minutes are included in the computation. The 
device was capped at a maximum value of 2500 per second. Thus, the 
theoretical ranges are (0.0-150,000.0) for a minute; (0.0-9,000,000.0) 
for an hour; and (0.0 to 216,000,000.0) for a day.</p>
<p><b>PAXLXSDM</b> (Standard deviation of the ambient light measures for the minute)<br>
This variable in the minute summary file (PAXMIN_G) is the standard 
deviation of the lux recorded during the minute by the device. The 
device records lux at 1 Hz. Only lux values from valid minutes are 
included in the computation.</p>
<p><b>PAXQFM, PAXQFH, PAXQFD</b> (Data quality flag for the minute/hour/day based on the quality control review)<br>
PAXQFM indicates the number of data quality flags identified during the 
minute. Zero indicates that no flags occurred. Values &gt;0 indicate 
that this minute is invalid based on the QC review. PAXQFH and PAXQFD 
indicates the number of data quality flags identified during the 
hour/day. Zero indicates that no flags occurred. Values &gt;0 indicate 
that one or more minutes in that hour/day was flagged as "invalid". As 
mentioned above, the QC flag is not considered during the calculation of
 MIMS-unit summary; however, the variable could be used as an overall 
metric indicator for the quality of data on this hour/day. Since 
multiple flags can exist in a single minute, this variable does not 
represent the number of invalid minutes within that hour/day.</p>
<p><b>PAXFLGSM</b> (Quality flag triggered)<br>
This variable encodes the flag(s) triggered during quality review for 
measurements taken in this minute. Since there can be multiple flags 
triggered during the same minute, the values in this variable can be 
recorded as a string code, for example: "A", "ABC", "EK", or "DHIJNO". 
The codes for the flags are:<br>
<br>
A = Occurrence of spikes on x-axis<br>
B = Occurrence of spikes on y-axis<br>
C = Occurrence of spikes on z-axis<br>
D = Occurrence of maximum <em>g</em>_values on the x-axis<br>
E = Occurrence of maximum <em>g</em>_values on the y-axis<br>
F = Occurrence of maximum <em>g</em>_values on the z-axis<br>
G = Occurrence of minimum <em>g</em>_values on the x-axis<br>
H = Occurrence of minimum <em>g</em>_values on the y-axis<br>
I = Occurrence of minimum <em>g</em>_values on the z-axis<br>
J = Occurrence of contiguous maximum <em>g</em>_values on the x-axis <br>
K = Occurrence of contiguous maximum <em>g</em>_values on the y-axis<br>
L = Occurrence of contiguous maximum <em>g</em>_values on the z-axis<br>
M = Occurrence of contiguous minimum <em>g</em>_values on the x-axis<br>
N = Occurrence of contiguous minimum <em>g</em>_values on the y-axis<br>
O = Occurrence of contiguous minimum <em>g</em>_values on the z-axis<br>
P = Occurrence of contiguous impossible <em>g</em>_values for gravity (i.e., zero <em>g </em>for gravity)<br>
Q = Occurrence of contiguous adjacent zero values on the z-, y-, or z-axis<br>
R = Occurrence of contiguous adjacent identical non-zero values on the x-, y-, or z-axis<br>
S = Occurrence of spikes on the x-axis in 1-second intervals<br>
T = Occurrence of spikes on the y-axis in 1-second intervals<br>
U = Occurrence of spikes on the z-axis in 1-second intervals<br>
V = Adjacent measures to periods of invalid data<br>
W = Interval jump in measurements on the x-axis (i.e., no measurement for the x-axis for this time period)<br>
X = Interval jump in measurements on the y-axis (i.e., no measurement for the y-axis for this time period)<br>
Y = Interval jump in measurements on the z-axis (i.e., no measurement for the z-axis for this time period)<br>

<p>The PAM component was reintroduced to NHANES in 2011-2014 and was 
included in the 2012 NHANES National Youth Fitness Survey (NNYFS). A 
total of 16,417 persons ages 3 years and older wore the PAM during these
 surveys and had data available for analysis: 2011-2012 NHANES 
participants 6 years and older (n=6,917); 2013-14 NHANES participants 3 
years and older (n=7,776); and 2012 NNYFS participants 3-15 years 
(1,477). In addition, PAM data were collected for 3-5 years old 
participants in the 2012 NHANES (n=247) as well. However, due to 
disclosure concerns, these data are only available in the NCHS RDC. 
Overall, 96% of participants with data wore the PAM until the 9<sup>th</sup>
 day. About 2%&nbsp;of the participants with PAM data wore it for less 
than 7 days. In NHANES and the NNYFS, approximately 99% of the PAMs in 
each survey were placed on the non-dominant arm of the participant.</p>
<p>Users should note that 1/80th of a second of data is missing in each 
minute. This results in 18 seconds of data missing every 24-hour day. 
This was due to a computational error that was not detected until 
post-processing the data.
</p>
<p>Data quality review and the MIMS-unit calculation were conducted 
independently. As a result, MIMS-units could be computed when QC flags 
are found for any given minute. Similarly, if the MIMS-unit summary 
couldn’t be computed for a given minute (i.e., a -0.01 value was 
assigned to the MIMS-unit for that minute) this could possibly&nbsp;NOT 
trigger a QC flag. Data users can use the QC codes to exclude MIMS-unit 
data from analysis as needed.  </p>
<p>An open-source algorithm was used with the 80 Hz accelerometer data 
to predict time periods of wake wear, sleep wear, or non-wear data, and 
assign a confidence value ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 to indicate the 
algorithm’s confidence that the time periods are wake wear, sleep wear 
or non-wear. In most cases, the algorithm identified a category for each
 minute. Sometimes, the algorithm was uncertain how to categorize a 
period of time. This resulted in unknown time periods. This algorithm 
used three steps.
</p>
<p>In the first step, which used 1.5 minute windows of data, signal 
features (e.g., signal power, variance of orientation, orientation 
change) were extracted from the raw data and a machine learning 
algorithm was used to predict whether each 30 seconds of data was wake 
wear, sleep wear, or non-wear. The algorithm attempted to clarify 
periods of data when the accelerometer's default Idle Sleep Mode (ISM) 
was operating. The ISM is a battery saving feature, but unfortunately it
 removes useful low motion time and frequency domain information that 
would have enhanced the algorithm’s prediction. When ISM periods 
occurred in the data, the algorithm used the 10 seconds of data just 
before the PAM initiated the ISM as a proxy for the data automatically 
stored during the period of the ISM. For each segment of data identified
 as ISM data, the 10 seconds prior to the start of the segment (which 
contained some information characterizing low movement&nbsp;behavior 
with no fluctuation &gt; 0.040 <em>g</em>) was copied over the ISM data 
(which contained no information). This should be considered as an 
approximation, because the 10 seconds of pre-ISM data was typically 
copied many times over throughout the ISM period. Testing suggested, 
however, that this small amount of information was valuable in 
differentiating waking low activity&nbsp;behavior, sleep, and non-wear 
time periods. Therefore, an algorithm optimized for this type of 
reversed-ISM data was used to categorize each 30-second window (using 
the two adjacent 10-second windows of data). Thirty-second windows were 
used because the algorithm's validation dataset used polysomnography for
 sleep detection, which was marked for sleep/wake state at 30 seconds 
intervals. It was necessary to perform this procedure, since the initial
 algorithm process (mentioned above) used 1.5-minute windows of data for
 all decision making, so waking low activity and sleep, or sleep and 
non-wear, were sometimes indistinguishable.
</p>
<p>In the second step, minimum durations (i.e., wake wear time period 
&lt;3 minutes, sleep wear period &lt;10 minutes, and non-wear period 
&lt;10 minutes) were filtered based on information from the prior and 
subsequent periods.  Specifically, the summation of confidence values 
for each category from the current and adjacent periods (the periods 
immediately before and after the current period) was calculated. If the 
prior and subsequent periods had the same predicted category, and the 
sum of the confidence values of the prior and subsequent classes was 
greater than twice the sum of the confidence values of the predicted 
category from the current period, then predicted category of the current
 period was switched to the predicted category of the adjacent periods. 
If the prior and subsequent categories did not have the same predicted 
category, then the predicted category of the current category was 
reassigned to the predicted category of the adjacent period with the 
higher confidence value.
</p>
<p>In the third step, longer periods were considered. Orientation 
changes were used to potentially flip some labels from non-wear to 
sleep, or sleep to non-wear, for longer intervals of time. This was to 
ensure that the final predicted sleep periods included of commonly 
observed periodic changes in the orientation due to body reorientation 
on the bed during sleep.
